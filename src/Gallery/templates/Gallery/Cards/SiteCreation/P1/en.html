        <h1>Building This Website</h1>

        <h2>Quick Overview</h2>
        <p>
            I built this site with <strong>Django</strong>. The main feature is a simple blog,
            and it also supports localization. The idea was both to practice my skills
            and to have a place to share some info about myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            The database runs on <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>. I handled everything on my own:
            design, development, and deployment. Requests go through <strong>nginx</strong>,
            served by <strong>gunicorn</strong>. The site runs on <strong>HTTPS</strong>
            with a free certificate from <strong>Let’s Encrypt</strong>.
            The whole project is packed into Docker Compose and starts with a single command.
            It’s hosted on my personal server, with my own domain.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also set up a small CI/CD pipeline: whenever I push to <code>main</code>,
            the server automatically updates files and restarts the containers.
        </p>

        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
            This is my first Django project that actually made it to a real release.
            I had tried Django before, but my projects always stayed unfinished.
            I experimented with an async server, websockets, a small chat,
            and even a tiny game. But this blog is the one I finally brought online.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why “part 1”? Well, I do plan to keep working on it.
            It’s both fun and potentially useful. But plans don’t always turn into reality.
        </p>
        <p>
            I actually wrote the site about half a year ago,
            but only deployed it recently — first I had exams,
            then I went home to relax, and other stuff kept getting in the way.
        </p>

        <h2>A Bit About the Process</h2>
        <p>
            Development itself wasn’t too hard — Django turned out to be a solid and
            well-designed framework. Deployment though, that’s where the challenges came in.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, I needed a server. I didn’t want to use my main PC,
            so I decided to go with a <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong>.
            That came with its own issues: I needed a case (so I 3D-printed one),
            and later found out I’d placed it in a bad spot — right next to my desktop PC
            and a radiator, so it was overheating. I had to add a fan.
            Big thanks to my dad for helping with electronics advice.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the server ready, I hit another problem: my router
            <strong>Xiaomi Mi Router 4C</strong> blocks port 80,
            and you can’t disable it. The only solution (short of buying a new router)
            was flashing OpenWRT
            (<a href="https://openwrt.org/ru/toh/xiaomi/xiaomi_mi_router_4c" target="_blank">link</a>).
            Took me a while to build up the courage, but in the end it was pretty simple.
            I needed port 80 for Let’s Encrypt and HTTPS to work properly.
        </p>
        <p>
            After that, it still took me about a week to finish setting things up
            in my free time: wrapping everything in Docker, configuring nginx,
            and polishing the environment. And now here we are — you’re reading this post.
